## What is it?

Detecting human faces and recognizing faces and facial expressions has always been an area of interest for different applications such as games, utilities and even security. With the advancement of machine learning, the techniques of detection and recognition have become more accurate and precise than ever before.

However, machine learning remains a relatively complex field that could feel intimidating or inaccessible to many of us. Luckily, in the last couple of years, several organizations and open source communities have been developing tools and libraries that help abstract the complex mathematical agorithms in order to encourage developers to easily create learning models and train them using any programming languages. 

As part of this study, I created a Javascript framework built on top of the work of several open source projects and models with the hope to reduce the entry barrier for developers and to encourage them to focus more on developing innovative applications that make use of face detection and recognition.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning in particular don't have to be difficult and we hope that the FaceDetect framework gives developers the means to include face detection and recognition in a seamless way in their applications.
